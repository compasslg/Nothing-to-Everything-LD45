# Nothing-to-Everything-LD45
## Introduction
This is all the source code of the card game *Nothing to Everything* I made for Ludum Dare 45 Compo event. All the game code, art, and sound effect are produced by me within two days, and the code here should only be used for learning purposes.

The theme of the event was "Start with Nothing". The link of the LD45 page and standalone versions of the game itself are below:
